/**
 * Header: oaBussCompPresets.js
 * Purpose: The master buss compressor's factory settings, and nothing else.
 * Description: Data, kept out of oaBussComp.js.
 *
 *   READING THE NUMBERS. Four of these fields are POSITIONS on a stepped pot,
 *   not values, because that is what the hardware has. The tables they index
 *   live in oaBussComp.js; here is what the numbers mean:
 *
 *     ratio    0…10 →  1.3  1.5  2  3  4  5  10  20  -2.5  -1.5  -0.5
 *              Everything from 8 up is a NEGATIVE ratio: past the threshold the
 *              output goes DOWN as the input goes up. Two of the settings below
 *              use them on purpose.
 *
 *     attack   0…9  →  .1  .3  1  3  6  10  15  20  30  40   (ms)
 *              A LOW number is a FAST attack, which catches the transient and
 *              softens it. The punchy settings are all at the top of this list.
 *
 *     release  0…10 →  .05 .1 .15 .2 .3 .4 .6 .8 1.2  AUTO  AUTO 2
 *              9 is AUTO and is where most of these sit. It is two time
 *              constants at once — 100 ms for transients, 12 s for the bed
 *              underneath — which no single position can do.
 *
 *     sc       the side-chain high-pass, in Hz. 0 is OUT.
 *
 *   THE SETTINGS WORTH KNOWING, which most of these are built around:
 *
 *     THE CLASSIC is 4:1, attack slowish, release AUTO, threshold pulled down
 *     until the meter shows two or three dB. That is `glue`, and it is what
 *     "sounds like a record" means when people say it about this box. More than
 *     four dB on a mix bus is usually a decision rather than an accident.
 *
 *     A SLOW ATTACK IS WHAT MAKES IT PUNCHIER. Let the front of the hit through
 *     untouched and clamp only the body behind it, and the transient ends up
 *     LOUDER relative to everything else than it was before compression.
 *     `punch` and `smack` are that, at 30 and 40 ms.
 *
 *     THE SIDE-CHAIN FILTER IS NOT OPTIONAL ON MODERN MATERIAL. A record with
 *     real sub-bass drives a full-band detector from the kick alone, and the
 *     whole mix ducks in time with it. Every setting here that expects bass has
 *     `sc` up around 60–120 Hz.
 *
 *     NEGATIVE RATIOS are the Bus+ addition. `pump` and `slam` use them: at
 *     -1.5:1 a signal over the threshold is pushed BELOW it, so loud material
 *     digs a hole in the mix and everything else swells into it. Musical on a
 *     dance record, a disaster on a ballad.
 *
 *   Loaded before oaBussComp.js.
