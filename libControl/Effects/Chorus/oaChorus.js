/**
 * Header: oaChorus.js
 * Purpose: A dimensional stereo chorus, sat after each tape echo.
 * Description: The box this models was never really a chorus — it was a width
 *   box. A conventional chorus sweeps a delayed copy hard enough that you hear
 *   the pitch move, which is the warble everyone recognises. This does the
 *   opposite: the sweep is kept so shallow it is almost inaudible on its own,
 *   the two sides are swept in OPPOSITE directions, and the wet copy is added
 *   to the left and SUBTRACTED from the right.
 *
 *   That last part is the whole trick. Out-of-phase across the pair, the wet
 *   signal cancels itself when the mix is folded to mono, so the effect adds
 *   almost nothing you can point at — the ear reads the phase difference
 *   between the sides as space, and the sound simply arrives wider and closer
 *   without a warble sitting on top of it.
 *
 *   Like the original there are no knobs: an OFF button and four modes, mutual
 *   exclusive, going from a gentle shimmer to the deepest setting the box has.
 */

// Every setting the box has lives in oaChorusModes.js, loaded first: the four
// buttons alone, and the combinations they make when more than one is held down.
