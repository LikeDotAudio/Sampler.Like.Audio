/**
 * Header: oaChorusModes.js
 * Purpose: Every setting the Dimension box has, and nothing else.
 * Description: Data, lifted out of oaChorus.js.
 *
 *   WHY THERE ARE TWELVE OF THEM AND STILL ONLY FOUR BUTTONS. The original has
 *   no knobs at all — four latching buttons and a bypass. What is easy to miss
 *   from photographs is that the buttons were meant to be pressed IN
 *   COMBINATION: singly they run from a gentle shimmer (1) to the deepest the
 *   box goes (4), and pressed together they add, giving a set of intermediate
 *   and extreme widths that no single button reaches. That is the whole reason a
 *   four-button box is worth twelve settings.
 *
 *   So a MODE here is a combination, and `buttons` lists which caps are down.
 *   The panel draws four buttons plus OFF, exactly as the hardware does, and
 *   pressing one toggles it into or out of the current combination — the table
 *   below is what that combination resolves to.
 *
 *   HOW THE COMBINATIONS ARE VOICED. Each button is a slightly different BBD
 *   delay and sweep. Pressing two together deepens the wet blend and widens the
 *   sweep without simply doubling either — two sweeps at different rates
 *   partially cancel, so the depth rises less than the sum and the RATE lands
 *   between the two. The values below follow that: the mix is roughly the larger
 *   plus half the smaller, the depth a little under the sum, and the rate the
 *   average pulled toward whichever button is deeper.
 *
 *   ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. `unit.chorus` is stored per delay as an INDEX into
 *   this table, so entries 0 to 4 keep the meaning they shipped with — OFF and
 *   the four single buttons — and every combination is appended after them. A
 *   session saved on mode 3 still comes back on mode 3.
 *
 *   Loaded before oaChorus.js.
