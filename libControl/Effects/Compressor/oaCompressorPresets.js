/**
 * Header: oaCompressorPresets.js
 * Purpose: The limiting amplifier's factory settings, and nothing else.
 * Description: Data, lifted out of oaCompressor.js.
 *
 *   READING THE NUMBERS. Two of these fields do not mean what they look like:
 *
 *     `input` IS THE THRESHOLD. The box has no threshold knob — the threshold is
 *     fixed at -24dB inside it and input drives the signal into it. A preset
 *     with input 20 is a preset that compresses hard, whatever else it says.
 *     `output` puts back what the squashing took away, which is why the two
 *     always move in opposite directions.
 *
 *     BOTH TIME KNOBS RUN BACKWARDS, like the original. 0 is fully
 *     counter-clockwise and SLOWEST (800µs attack, 1.1s release); 1 is fully
 *     clockwise and FASTEST (20µs, 50ms). A preset with attack 0.1 lets the
 *     whole transient through before it clamps; one with attack 0.95 catches the
 *     stick itself.
 *
 *   THE SETTINGS WORTH KNOWING, which most of these are built around:
 *
 *     The classic vocal setting is 4:1 with the attack around a quarter of its
 *     travel and the release around 60% — slow enough to keep the consonants,
 *     fast enough to catch the line. It is famous because it flatters almost
 *     anything, and it is `vocaltex` below.
 *
 *     ALL BUTTONS IN was a fault condition on the hardware — every ratio button
 *     pushed at once, the threshold collapsing, the knee smearing and the attack
 *     lagging behind itself. It is used on drum rooms, ambience mics and
 *     parallel busses, which is exactly what `smash`, `roomcrush` and
 *     `loopsmash` are.
 *
 *     Below 100% blend is parallel compression: the peaks are controlled and the
 *     transients survive underneath. On a drum machine that is usually the one
 *     you want.
 *
 *   Loaded before oaCompressor.js.
