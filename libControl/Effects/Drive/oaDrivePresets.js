/**
 * Header: oaDrivePresets.js
 * Purpose: The pedal's factory settings, and nothing else.
 * Description: Data, lifted out of oaDrive.js. Each entry is a full pedal: a
 *   voicing (`mode`), how hard it is driven, the two extra faults (starve and
 *   octave), the tone control and the blend.
 *
 *   WHAT THE THREE VOICINGS CAN AND CANNOT DO, which is what these settings are
 *   built around:
 *
 *     od    tanh, dead centre. Symmetric, so ODD harmonics only — the third,
 *           fifth, seventh. Hollow and woody. Every "pushed amp" sound is here.
 *     tube  tanh off-centre. Lopsided clipping makes EVEN harmonics, the second
 *           above all, which is an octave and therefore reads as warmth. Every
 *           "console" and "tape push" sound is here.
 *     fuzz  a hard clamp at the rail. Square wave, endless harmonic series.
 *
 *   HOW THE FAMOUS CIRCUITS MAP ONTO THAT. The differences between the classic
 *   boxes are mostly (a) where they clip, (b) how symmetric the clipping is and
 *   (c) what the tone stack does either side of it:
 *
 *     A germanium fuzz has LESS gain than a silicon one and a softer, grainier
 *     break-up with a smooth top — so: fuzz voicing, moderate drive, tone well
 *     down. A silicon fuzz has more gain and more high-order harmonics — same
 *     voicing, much more drive, tone open.
 *
 *     A four-stage sustain fuzz is scooped and endless: maximum drive, tone
 *     pulled back to keep it from fizzing, mix at 100%.
 *
 *     The mid-hump overdrives (the green one at ~723Hz, the hard-clipping grey
 *     one at ~1kHz) get their character from a bandpass this pedal does not
 *     have — it has a single lowpass. The nearest honest thing is the right
 *     VOICING plus a tone setting that lands the energy in the same place, so
 *     those two are named for what they do rather than for what they are.
 *
 *   Loaded before oaDrive.js.
