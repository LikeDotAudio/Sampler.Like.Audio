/**
 * Header: oaFxBus.js
 * Purpose: The one node a voice connects to — pan, dry path, and every send.
 * Description: Sits above oaReverb.js and oaTapeDelay.js and knows about both.
 *   A voice gets a panner (or a plain gain) that goes straight to the output,
 *   plus one send gain per effect bus that this channel feeds. Sends are read
 *   when the voice is built, so a knob move lands on the next hit rather than
 *   re-levelling notes that are already ringing.
 *
 *   The channel's DRIVE pedal (oaDrive.js) goes in FRONT of all of that, so the
 *   reverbs and tapes are fed the distorted signal — a pedal sits on the floor
 *   before the desk, not in the aux rack. On a clean channel it builds nothing.
 *
 *   The channel's COMPRESSOR (oaCompressor.js) goes on the END of the dry path,
 *   after the pan. Unlike everything else here it is built ONCE per channel and
 *   shared by every voice, because a compressor with no memory of the last hit
 *   is not a compressor. That placement also means the sends are tapped ahead of
 *   it: the reverbs and tapes hear the channel's natural dynamics while the
 *   direct sound is squashed, which is the more useful of the two orders — a
 *   compressed send makes the tail swell up behind every hit.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RECORD BYPASS
//
// While a take is being recorded, every effect in the rack comes out of the
// path. Not turned down — OUT, so that nothing between the pad and the speaker
// is doing work that costs time:
//
//   the DRIVE pedal      a WaveShaper at 4x oversampling, which resamples up and
//                        back down and carries the filters to do it
//   the CHANNEL STRIP    an AudioWorklet, so at least one 128-frame quantum
//   the SENDS            no latency on the dry path, but a convolver and four
//                        tape worklets running for a monitor nobody is listening
//                        to is CPU that a glitch-free take needs more
//   the BUSS COMPRESSOR  another worklet, on the one path everything shares
//
// What is left is source → pan → master fade → out. The fade and the meters
// stay: they are not effects, and a take with no metering is worse than a take
// with three milliseconds more latency.
//
// It is deliberately a BUILD-TIME decision, read when each voice is built, so
// arming record does not re-plumb voices that are already sounding — the tail
// of the last hit rings out through the rack it was born into, and the next hit
// is dry. The alternative is a click on every arm.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PRE-FADER AND POST-FADER SENDS
//
// A send is POST-fader when the channel fader is upstream of the tap: pull the
// fader down and the effect goes with it, which is what you want when the
// effect is part of that channel's sound. It is PRE-fader when the tap is
// upstream of the fader: the send holds its level whatever the fader does, and
// at fader zero the channel is silent in the mix while STILL feeding the
// effect. That is how a headphone feed works, and how you get a reverb with no
// dry signal at all.
//
// Every send used to be post-fader, and not by decision: the channel fader was
// multiplied into each voice's own gain BEFORE the voice reached this file, so
// there was nowhere upstream of it to tap. The fader is a node in the chain
// now, which is what makes the distinction possible at all.
//
// WHICH IS WHICH is a property of the send, declared here, so the mixer's
// labels and the node graph cannot disagree — the panel reads this table to
// draw its PRE / POST headings. It is the LEFT COLUMN of the send grid that is
// pre-fader, which is why the flags alternate.

//
// They live in React state (and travel over MQTT), so this is a mirror the

// fader has to be a gain node between the pre-fader taps and the post-fader
// ones, and nothing on the audio side knew what the fader was set to.
//
// A side effect worth having: pad hits never applied the channel fader at all —
// only sequenced hits did, because only the sequencer multiplied it in — and an
// offline bounce ignored it too. One fader node in one place fixes all three.

// this channel feeds, and — on a driven channel — a whole pedal, waveshaper and
// all. At sixteenth notes across a full grid that is a few hundred nodes a
// second being wired into a graph that reaches the destination.
//
// The spec says a node with no references and no live input is collectable, and
// the browser does eventually collect them. "Eventually" is the problem: the
// collector runs when IT decides to, the pause lands wherever it lands, and a
// pause during playback is heard. Cutting each chain loose the moment its voice
// is done turns an unbounded pile of maybe-collectable nodes into a bounded one
// that is definitely gone, and moves the cost off the audio thread's back.
//
// Retirement is swept, not timed. A setTimeout per voice would be one timer per
// hit — the same churn in a different currency.
