/**
 * Header: OaOutOfCircuit.jsx
 * Purpose: The badge every effect panel wears while the rack is bypassed.
 * Description: Arming RECORD takes every effect out of the signal path (see
 *   OA_FX_BYPASS in ../FxBus/oaFxBus.js). The panels grey themselves out, which
 *   says "you cannot touch this" — this says WHY, and it has to, because a
 *   greyed panel with no explanation is indistinguishable from a broken one.
 *
 *   It lives here rather than in each faceplate for the reason the hooks do:
 *   six copies of one sentence is six chances for five of them to go stale, and
 *   the sentence is the part that has to be identical everywhere. The panels
 *   keep their own LOOK; what they must not each invent is the WORDING of a
 *   state they all share.
 *
 *   Paired with `window.useOaFxBypass()` and `window.oaBypassVeil()` in
 *   useOaPlugin.js — the hook that reports the state and the style that shows it.
