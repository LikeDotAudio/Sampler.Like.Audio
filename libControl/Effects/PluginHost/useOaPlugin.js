/**
 * Header: useOaPlugin.js
 * Purpose: The front panel's whole vocabulary. Four hooks, and no editor needs
 *   anything else from the audio layer.
 * Description: The rule this file enforces is simple: NOTHING IN A DISPLAY MAY
 *   NAME AN AUDIO NODE. Not an analyser, not a bus, not ctx.__oaComps, not the
 *   AudioContext itself. A panel asks for a plugin's frame and reads numbers out
 *   of it; that is the entire contract, and it is the reason the panels can now
 *   be tested, restyled and moved without an audio device in the room.
 *
 *   What the editors used to do instead, and what each hook replaces:
 *
 *     useOaFrame     Was: a rAF loop per panel, each one pulling a thousand
 *                    floats out of an analyser and reducing them to a peak. Two
 *                    panels watching one channel did that work twice, into two
 *                    freshly allocated arrays, sixty times a second. Now the
 *                    back end measures once into an array it already owns and
 *                    the panel reads a slot.
 *
 *     useOaState     Was: window.addEventListener('oa-comp-changed', …) written
 *                    out longhand in every editor, with the removal easy to
 *                    forget — and a listener that outlives its component keeps
 *                    the whole component alive with it.
 *
 *     useOaCurve     Was: each panel naming the specific function that bakes
 *                    its own shape — oaDriveCurve here, an impulse buffer
 *                    there, a bounced preview somewhere else. One question now,
 *                    answered with a Float32Array the back end already owns.
 *
 *     useOaParams    Was: editors reaching into OA_SYNTH_ENGINES to work out
 *                    which knobs a pad should show.
 *
 *   WHY THE DRAWING IS NOT REACT. Every one of these panels updates at frame
 *   rate, and a setState per frame per meter would re-render the tree sixty
 *   times a second to move a needle. useOaFrame hands the frame to a callback
 *   that writes to the DOM directly — a style height, a transform on an SVG
 *   node — and React never hears about it. That is deliberate: metering is not
 *   application state, it is a picture of a number.
 */

/**
 * Read a plugin's live binary frame every animation frame.
 *
 * `onFrame(frame, layout)` is called with the SAME Float32Array each time — do
 * not hold values across calls expecting them to be stable, and do not write to
 * it. Draw straight to the DOM from here; do not setState.
