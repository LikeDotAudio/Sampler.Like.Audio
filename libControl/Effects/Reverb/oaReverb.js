 * Header: oaReverb.js
 * Purpose: Two shared reverb machines for the whole kit, driven from a VARC.
 * Description: Every voice splits into a dry path straight to the output and a
 *   per-channel send into one of two reverbs. The tape delays (oaTapeDelay.js)
 *   feed them too — see `toRv` there.
 *
 *   The two units used to be a pair of dropdowns: pick a "tone" and a "size"
 *   from four fixed choices. They are now a parameter set modelled on the
 *   VARC 444V, addressed the way that machine is addressed — banks of
 *   programs loaded by number, and six sliders per page editing whatever the
 *   program loaded. See VarcRemote.jsx for the front panel.
 *
 *   WHY THE PARAMETERS LIVE IN THE IMPULSE RESPONSE. A 444V is a feedback delay
 *   network: a tank of delay lines with the output folded back into the input,
 *   processed sample by sample. This is a CONVOLUTION reverb — the room is
 *   precomputed as an impulse response and the browser convolves the audio
 *   against it. That sounds like a compromise, and for some parameters it is,
 *   but for the two that make a 444V sound like a 444V it is arguably the more
 *   direct route:
 *
 *     SHAPE and SPREAD are envelope controls. On the real machine they shape
 *     how energy BUILDS before it decays — the swell that makes a big hall read
 *     as big rather than merely long. In an FDN that has to be imposed on the
 *     tank from outside. In an impulse response the envelope IS the thing being
 *     drawn, so shape and spread are not approximated here at all: they are the
 *     literal curve of the tail.
 *
 *   What convolution genuinely costs us is that a parameter change means
 *   rebuilding the response rather than turning a knob on a running network,
 *   which takes a few milliseconds of arithmetic. Hence the debounce in
 *   oaRefreshReverb(). The real machine has the same tell for the same reason:
 *   the manual notes that changing SIZE briefly mutes the audio while it
 *   re-allocates its delay memory.
 *
 *   The response is built in oaBuildImpulse() below, in the order sound
 *   actually arrives: pre-delay, then discrete early reflections off the walls,
 *   then the diffuse late tail with its own two-band decay.
