 * Header: oaTapeDelayPresets.js
 * Purpose: The tape machine's factory settings, and nothing else.
 * Description: Data, lifted out of oaTapeDelay.js. Every entry is a full set of
 *   the seven tape parameters; applying one walks them through oaSetDelay() a
 *   parameter at a time, so each is clamped and each takes its head off the grid.
 *
 *   WHERE THE HEAD TIMES COME FROM. The machine this models has no delay-time
 *   knob at all — it has THREE PLAYBACK HEADS at fixed distances down the tape
 *   and a twelve-position selector that switches between them and their
 *   combinations (four echo-only, seven echo-plus-reverb, one reverb alone). The
 *   spacing is roughly 1 : 2 : 3, and almost every echo anyone remembers off that
 *   box is one of those combinations at a different tape speed.
 *
 *   This has two heads rather than three — left and right — so a combination
 *   becomes a PAIR of head times, and the ratio between them is the thing worth
 *   copying:
 *
 *     1:1     both heads together. A single hard slap, mono-centred.
 *     1:1.5   the classic tape-echo spread. Wide, and the repeats interleave.
 *     1:2     ping-pong. Every other repeat lands on the other side.
 *     1:3     the widest the original could do, heads 1 and 3 together.
 *
 *   The four the units boot with (slap, tape, space, dub) keep their keys,
 *   because OA_DELAY_UNITS names them and a saved song can too.
 *
 *   Loaded before oaTapeDelay.js, which reads this at load time to build the
 *   four machines' starting state.
