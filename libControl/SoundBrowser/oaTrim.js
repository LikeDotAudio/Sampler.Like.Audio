/**
 * The chop: four marks, and the one set of rules they all obey.
 *
 * IN and OUT keep something between them; the fades live inside that region and
 * cannot overlap each other. Getting that wrong is not a cosmetic bug — an OUT
 * dragged past IN is a negative region, which is a BufferSource that plays
 * nothing and says nothing about why.
 *
 * It lives on its own because two places chop the same sound: the browser,
 * before it lands (useSoundBrowseAudio), and the SAMPLER panel on the mixer,
 * after it has (SamplerEditor). One copy of the rules, so a sound cannot be
 * trimmed one way in one place and another way in the other.
