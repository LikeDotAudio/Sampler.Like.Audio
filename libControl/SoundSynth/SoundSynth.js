 * Header: DrumKit.js
 * Purpose: Shared 16-voice drum kit for the Sampler + Sequencer.
 * Description: Single source of truth for the drum-sound names/voices so the
 *   Sampler pads and the Sequencer tracks are the SAME kit. Also provides a
 *   shared AudioContext and a shared sample store, so a sample loaded on a
 *   Sampler pad is played by the Sequencer for that track too.
 *
 * Plain JS (not JSX) so it runs before the text/babel component scripts and
 * window.OA_DRUM_KIT is ready when they execute.
 *
 * Version: 26.07.11.1

// rest fill out a 5 × 5. Pad index === Sequencer track index === key into
// OA_DRUM_SAMPLES.
