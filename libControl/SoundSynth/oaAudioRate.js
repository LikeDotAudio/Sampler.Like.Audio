/**
 * Header: oaAudioRate.js
 * Purpose: ONE sample rate for the whole app, and the two constructors that
 *   guarantee every context actually runs at it.
 * Description: Every DSP module here turns seconds into samples somewhere — the
 *   reverb's decay multipliers, the tape's circular buffer length, the
 *   compressor's attack coefficients, the drum synth's bounced previews. Each
 *   used to answer "how many samples is that?" for itself, from whatever context
 *   it happened to be handed, with its own fallback when there was none:
 *
 *     oaDrumSynthPatches.js   OA_AUDIO_CTX.sampleRate || 44100
 *     useSeqRenderer.js       OA_AUDIO_CTX.sampleRate || 44100
 *     SoundRecorder.jsx       ctx.sampleRate || 48000
 *
 *   Three fallbacks, two of them disagreeing with the fake used by the tests and
 *   with the 48kHz most devices actually come up at. Nothing sounded broken,
 *   because a wrong rate is not a crash: it is a preview bounced at 44.1k being
 *   drawn against a tail computed at 48k, an offline render printing a tape echo
 *   whose head spacing is 8.8% off the one being monitored, and a recording
 *   written into a WAV header that says something the samples do not.
 *
 *   THE INVARIANT. `OA_SAMPLE_RATE` is the rate every context in this app runs
 *   at — live, offline preview, offline bounce, test harness. It is seeded at
 *   48000 and RECONCILED to the live device the first time a live context is
 *   built, because that is the one rate nothing here gets to choose: a browser
 *   may refuse the requested rate, and if it does, the device wins and every
 *   offline context must follow it rather than the other way round.
 *
 *   Ask through oaSampleRate(ctx) rather than reading ctx.sampleRate, and build
 *   contexts through the two helpers below rather than with `new`. Then there is
 *   exactly one number, and a module that converts seconds to samples cannot
 *   convert them against a different clock than its neighbour.
 *
 *   THE ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION is offline processing of an ALREADY DECODED
 *   buffer — trimming, fading and pitching a loaded sample in oaDrumkitSynth.js.
 *   Those render at the source buffer's own rate on purpose: re-rendering a
 *   44.1k sample at 48k to trim 20ms off its head would resample the whole thing
 *   for nothing. The rate here is the rate the app SYNTHESISES and MIXES at.
