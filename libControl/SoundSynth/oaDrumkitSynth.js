// worth doing. What it is not worth doing is FORGETTING, which is what used to
// happen: the cache was written on precache and never read back out. Two ways
// that ended badly.
//
//   IT WAS NEVER EVICTED ON A SAMPLE CHANGE. Loading a new sound onto a pad
//   replaced OA_DRUM_SAMPLES[idx] and left sixty-one renders of the OLD sound
//   sitting under the same key. They were not merely wasted — oaTriggerTone
//   reads the cache BEFORE the entry, so tone mode went on playing the sample
//   that used to be on that pad. A silent wrong-sound bug on top of the leak.
//
//   IT HAD NO CEILING. The range below is 61 renders per pad, and pitching down
//   two octaves makes a buffer four times longer, so the set weighs about
//   seventy times the original sample. A one-second stereo 48k sample is 384KB,
//   so one pad is ~27MB and a full 5x5 grid is over half a gigabyte of
//   AudioBuffer. Long before it ran out, the collector pressure alone was
//   enough to stall the main thread — and a main-thread stall during playback
//   is heard as a dropout, which is what "it slowed down and distorted" is.
//
// So: a byte budget, least-recently-used eviction across pads, and a hard drop
// whenever the pad's sound changes underneath it.
