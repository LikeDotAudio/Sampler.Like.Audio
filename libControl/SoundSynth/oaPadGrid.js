/**
 * Header: oaPadGrid.js
 * Purpose: How many pads the kit has, and how they are laid out.
 * Description: The app shipped with a fixed 4 × 4 of 16 voices, and that 16 was
 *   written into the pad grid, the mixer strips, the sequencer rows, the send
 *   arrays and the save files. This is the one place it is decided now —
 *   everything else counts from OA_PAD_COUNT.
 *
 *   Loads before every other audio file so the count is known by the time the
 *   kit, the synth patches and the effect sends are built.
 *
 *   Changing the layout keeps what is already there: growing appends new voices,
 *   shrinking hides the tail rather than erasing it, so the samples and patches
 *   on pads 17-25 are still waiting if the grid grows back.
