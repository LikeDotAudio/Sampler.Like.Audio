/**
 * Header: oaResident.js
 * Purpose: What the engine holds in RAM, so that playing a sound is never the
 *   moment it gets built.
 * Description: A sampler is judged on the gap between the hit and the sound.
 *   Everything that can be computed ahead of the hit therefore is, and what
 *   comes out of that computation stays resident:
 *
 *     SAMPLES   decoded once into OA_DRUM_SAMPLES, plus the pitched copy each
 *               pad actually plays (oaPrecachePad) and Tone Mode's per-semitone
 *               renders (oaPrecacheTones).
 *     SYNTH     every voice's patch is already a plain object in memory and on
 *               localStorage; its bounced waveform is rendered for all pads at
 *               startup instead of when a pad is first looked at.
 *     IRs       every impulse response the reverbs draw, kept under the settings
 *               that drew it, so recalling a program is a lookup and not the
 *               couple of million random numbers it was the first time.
 *
 *   Two things this file insists on, both learned the hard way in the Tone Mode
 *   cache above it:
 *
 *   A CACHE WITH NO CEILING IS A LEAK. Every store here is byte-budgeted with
 *   least-recently-used eviction. "Hold everything" and "hold what fits, drop
 *   the coldest" are the same thing right up until the machine starts swapping,
 *   and the second one keeps working after that.
 *
 *   WHAT IS RESIDENT MUST BE COUNTABLE. oaResidentReport() adds up every store
 *   by class, so "is it all in memory?" has an answer with a number in it
 *   instead of an opinion. The Mixer's diagnostic reads it.

 * A keyed AudioBuffer store with a budget.
 *
 * `budgetOf` is read on every put rather than captured, so a budget can be
 * raised or lowered at runtime and take effect on the next insert.
 *
 * A buffer bigger than the entire budget is handed straight back UNSTORED: the
 * alternative is evicting the whole cache to make room for one item that will
 * itself be evicted by the next one, which is a loop that only burns memory
 * bandwidth. The caller still gets its buffer; it just has to build it again
 * next time, which is the honest outcome when it does not fit.
