/**
 * Header: OaReadout.jsx
 * Purpose: The big value overlay that stands beside a control while it is moving.
 * Description: The sequencer grid has had one of these from the start — hold a
 *   step and a large VELOCITY column appears next to your finger. It exists
 *   because on a phone the thing being adjusted is underneath the hand adjusting
 *   it, and an 8px number engraved under a knob is unreadable at the moment it
 *   matters most. Every other control on the desk had the same problem and none
 *   of them said anything.
 *
 *   So the sequencer's overlay is generalised here and every control shares it.
 *   A control calls useOaReadout() with what it would like shown and reports the
 *   pointer once, at the start of the drag; the hook watches the window for the
 *   rest. That last part is the important one — the release is caught on the
 *   window in the capture phase, so however a control handles pointer capture,
 *   and wherever the finger ends up when it lifts, the overlay cannot be left
 *   stranded on screen.
 *
 *   ONE overlay exists, not one per control: the value lives in a module
 *   variable and the component subscribes to it, so a knob mid-drag can push a
 *   new reading without owning the thing that draws it.
 */
