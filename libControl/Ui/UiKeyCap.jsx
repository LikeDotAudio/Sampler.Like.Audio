/**
 * Header: UiKeyCap.jsx
 * Purpose: Every pressable cap in the rack, in one place.
 * Description: Three panels had three implementations of the same object: the
 *   remote's `Key`, the width box's `DimButton` and the limiter's
 *   `PushButton`. All three are a moulded cap that goes DOWN when it is engaged
 *   rather than changing colour — which is the whole reason they read as
 *   switches instead of as web buttons — and all three drew it with the same
 *   four tricks:
 *
 *     a light-to-dark gradient down the face, so the cap has a top and a bottom;
 *     a hard 2px shadow beneath it, which is the cap standing off the panel;
 *     `translateY` plus an INSET shadow when pressed, which is it sitting in its
 *     well with the panel shading it;
 *     a transition short enough (60ms) to feel mechanical rather than animated.
 *
 *   Keeping three copies meant three slightly different travel distances and two
 *   different ivories. One component, three TONES.
 */

/**
 * `tone` is the material, not the state:
 *
 *   cream   ivory plastic — the remote's keypad and the width-box buttons
 *   blue    the machine-select caps, which are blue on the original
 *   panel    aluminium-white, for a plate that is already painted (the limiter)
 *   red     the bypass cap, which is red everywhere it appears
 *
 * `lit` is the state: down in its well, engaged.
