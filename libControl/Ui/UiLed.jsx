/**
 * Header: UiLed.jsx
 * Purpose: Lit segments, and the dark filter they sit behind.
 * Description: An LED readout is not coloured text. What makes it read as a lamp
 *   is the BLOOM, and the bloom is two shadows on purpose:
 *
 *     a tight bright one, which is the segment itself;
 *     a wide dim one, which is the light spilling into the filter around it.
 *
 *   A single blur gives you a fuzzy letter instead — the halo has to be much
 *   wider than the glyph to look like glow rather than like something out of
 *   focus. That is the one detail worth keeping in a shared component, because
 *   it is the detail everyone reimplements slightly wrong.
 */

/**
 * A run of segments. `dim` is a half-driven segment — it still EMITS, faintly,
 * because killing the glow entirely makes it read as printed ink rather than as
 * a dimmer light, and the display uses dimming to mean "not committed yet".
