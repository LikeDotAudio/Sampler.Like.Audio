/**
 * Header: UiPanel.jsx
 * Purpose: The floating shell every editor is drawn inside.
 * Description: Six panels open over the mixer, and all six were repeating the
 *   same eleven lines: fixed to the bottom centre, translated back by half its
 *   own width, panel background, one-pixel border, the big soft drop shadow, a
 *   z-index above the strips, and a header row with a coloured title on the left
 *   and a close button pushed to the right.
 *
 *   Repeating it meant they drifted — two different z-indexes, three different
 *   corner radii, one panel whose title was 11px while the rest were 12. None of
 *   that is visible one panel at a time; all of it is visible when you open two.
 *
 *   So the shell is one component and a panel supplies only what is actually its
 *   own: how wide it is, what it is called, and what goes inside.
 */

/**
 * `title` is the coloured name on the left; `tint` is the unit's colour, so a
 * delay's panel is headed in that delay's colour exactly as its strip is.
 * `sub` is the small grey note beside it. Anything in `actions` sits between the
 * title and the close button.
