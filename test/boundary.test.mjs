/**
 * Header: boundary.test.mjs
 * Purpose: Keep the front end and the back end apart, permanently.
 * Description: A separation like this survives exactly as long as something
 *   checks it. Nothing about the code stops an editor from reaching into
 *   ctx.__oaComps again next month — it would work, it would look local and
 *   reasonable in review, and the coupling would be back.
 *
 *   So this reads the display sources and fails if they name anything on the
 *   audio side. It is a lint, not a unit test, and it is the only kind of test
 *   that can defend an architectural boundary rather than a behaviour.
 *
 *   The rule: A FILE THAT DRAWS MAY NOT NAME AN AUDIO NODE.
 *
 *   What a display is allowed to say instead is the short list in
 *   useOaPlugin.js: ask for a frame, read a slot, set a parameter, plot a curve.
