/**
 * Header: fakeReact.mjs
 * Purpose: Enough React to render a panel once and see whether it throws.
 * Description: The editors are the half of this codebase Babel checks least.
 *   It parses them, so a syntax error is caught; it says nothing about a
 *   variable that no longer exists, a hook called after an early return, or a
 *   prop that was renamed on one side of a call and not the other. Those all
 *   look fine right up until the panel is opened.
 *
 *   This is not React. It does not reconcile, diff, or update — it calls a
 *   component function once with a real hook implementation underneath and
 *   hands back the element tree. That is exactly enough to prove a panel can be
 *   opened, which is the failure this is here to catch.
 *
 *   HOOK ORDER IS ENFORCED, deliberately. The hooks are stored positionally,
 *   the way React stores them, so a component that calls a different number of
 *   hooks on its second render is caught here rather than in the browser.
