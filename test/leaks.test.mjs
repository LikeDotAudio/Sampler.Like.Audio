/**
 * Header: leaks.test.mjs
 * Purpose: Prove the app can play for a long time without getting heavier.
 * Description: This file exists because of a failure nobody could see while it
 *   was happening: the sampler got slower and dirtier the longer a session ran.
 *   That is what a leak sounds like. Memory fills, the collector runs harder and
 *   longer, its pauses land on the main thread, the audio thread misses its
 *   deadline, and a missed deadline is heard as a crackle. "Slow" and
 *   "distorted" are one symptom, not two.
 *
 *   Every test here is the same shape: measure, do a lot of work, measure again,
 *   and assert the second number is the first one. Not "small" — the SAME. A
 *   leak that grows slowly still grows.
