/**
 * Header: resident.test.mjs
 * Purpose: What the engine holds in memory, and what stops it holding too much.
 * Description: Two failures live here and neither one announces itself.
 *
 *   THE CACHE THAT ISN'T. A memoised build is invisible when it silently stops
 *   memoising — the app is correct, just slower, and the slowness turns up as a
 *   dropout in someone's take rather than as a test failure. So the cache is
 *   asserted on identity: the same settings must hand back the SAME AudioBuffer
 *   object, because that is the only evidence that the second build never ran.
 *
 *   THE CACHE THAT NEVER LETS GO. The Tone Mode cache above it ate half a
 *   gigabyte before anyone noticed, so every store in this engine is budgeted.
 *   A budget nobody tests is a comment.
